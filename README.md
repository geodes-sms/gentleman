## Integration

Gentleman can be added to any web application in 2 steps:

1. Add the [required scripts](#scripts) to your page
2. [Decorate an HTML Tag](#decorate-an-html-tag) **OR** [Dynamically create an instance](#dynamically-create-an-instance)

### Scripts

- `gentleman.core.js` (*required*): Gentleman library.
- `gentleman.app.js` (*optional*): Provides an IDE to create concepts and projections.

### Decorate an HTML Tag

```html
<html>
    <body>
        ...
        <div data-gentleman="editor"></div>
        ...
        <script src="gentleman.core.js"></script>
        <script>
            let editor = Gentleman.activateEditor()[0]
            editor.init({...});
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Dynamically create an instance

```javascript
// your application
const App = {};
...
// create and initialize an editor
let editor = Gentleman.createEditor();
editor.init({...});
...
// append the editor to the page
App.container.append(editor.container);
```

### Browser Compatibility

Gentleman supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).

# Installation 💻

## Building the Code

To build the code, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command to install the dependencies

```
$ npm install
```

### Development

When working on the code, you will need a folder named `.internal` at the root of the project.  
This folder is used as the source of content for the *webpack-dev-server* (see [webpack.dev.js](/webpack.dev.js)) that provides live reloading. It can be used to store dev-specific files and assets.

1. Create a folder named `.internal` in the root
2. Add an `index.html` file in the `.internal` folder
3. Add the script `<script src="app.bundle.js"></script>` at the end of the `index.html` page

Once you have the `.internal` folder in place, execute the following command

```
$ npm run start
```

This will start a development server (*webpack-dev-server*) and should open the application in the browser.

### Production

To deploy the code or test in a production environment, follow these steps.

1. Update the [build file](scripts/build.js) with newly created css files
2. From the project folder, execute the following command to build the code for production

```
$ npm run build
```
