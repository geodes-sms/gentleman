# Gentleman - A lightweight web-based projectional editor generator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geodes-sms/gentleman.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geodes-sms/gentleman)

Gentleman aims to **to close the gap between models and domain experts**.

> **Projectional-editing**
> 1. No parser needed: the user manipulates the AST directly (through projections)
> 2. Support of various notations: tables, math formulas, graphics...
> 3. Composition of any language without introducing syntactic ambiguities

## Workflow

1. **Language enginneer**
   1. Define a model for your DSL concepts or import and Ecore model
   2. Create projections to interact with your DSL concepts

2. **Domain expert**
   1. Use the generated editor to create the model instances
   2. Personnalize freely the presentation of your instance

## Features

- Platform agnostic: Gentleman target the web (no installation required)
- Support textual and tabular notations and multimedia content
- Offer specialized UI units for projection layout and fields
- Integration with Ecore: Define an Ecore model and use it with Gentleman projections

### 👉 Demonstration

Take a look at the [demonstration (MODELS 2020) and see the tool in action](https://youtu.be/wJ4hVZjmrv4).

## Integration

### Decorate an HTML Tag

```html
<html>
    <body>
        ...
        <div data-gentleman></div>
        ...
        <script src="gentleman.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Create an instance in JS

```javascript
const MODEL = {JSON};
const PROJECTION = {JSON}

var editor = Gentleman.createEdiotr();
editor.init(MODEL, PROJETION)
```

# Installation

⚠️ **Gentleman is currently in alpha.** ⚠️

## Building the Code

To build the code, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command:

```
$ npm install
```

# Documentation

<!-- You can read the documentation for Gentleman [here](https://geodes-sms.github.io/gentleman/docs). If you would like to help improve this documentation, the source for many of the docs can be found in the doc folder within this repository.  -->

## Projection

A projection is a representation of a concept that can be visualized and interacted with in the graphical user interface (GUI).
Multiple projections may be defined for a single concept so as to allow different representation and level of granularity.

> **Example**  
> Consider the concept `Person` with attributes such as `name`, `age`, `height`, `shape`, and `type`.  
To manipulate a collection of `Person`, a *Table* is a highly efficient notation to make changes, but does not offer
enough flexibility for viewing purposes. However, a *List* which is less rigid in both structure and presentation
fit perfectly with this scenario.  
Therefore, a good strategy would be to define a projection per use cases:  
**(1)** Edit a *Person* and view all their attributes `->` Table projection  
**(2)** Enumerate all the defined *Person* showing only their *name* `->` List projection

Every projection is a composition of *layout*, *field* and *static* elements; all rendered as HTML elements.
They can be customized, individually or globally, directly with *style* rules or though external *CSS*.

### Layout

A layout element is used to organize elements presented in the GUI.
Predefined layouts:

- Wrap
- Stack
- Cell

### Field

A field element is used to receive and process input and output

- Text
- Binary
- Choice
- List
- Table

### Static

A static element is used to add element that do not accept any input and may only react to changes in the environment.

- Text
- Image
- Link
- HTML
